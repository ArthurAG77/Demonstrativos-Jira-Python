# Demonstrativos-Jira-Python
The purpose of this repository is to house my small personal project, which consists of an indicator generation tool based on a Jira board. This tool provides insights into the number of issues created, the time taken to resolve them, and if they remain unsolved, it calculates the number of days elapsed since their creation.
